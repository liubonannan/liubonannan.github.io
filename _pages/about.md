I am a Ph.D. Candidate in **Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC)** at [Muenster University](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/), Germany, supervised by **Prof. Christina Huf**. Currently, I am also a Visiting Researcher at **Pädagogische Hochschule Zürich** (PH Zürich), Switzerland.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **posthumanist pedagogy**, **educational ethnography**, and **childhood studies**. Specifically, I explore the "more-than-human" entanglements and anthropomorphic phenomena in preschool children's play, rethinking how children interact with their material environments—from pens and leaves to "nothingness."

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my M.A. in Childhood Studies from the **University of Leeds** (UK) and an M.A. in Pedagogy from **Jilin University** (China).

### Research Interests
